# heart-disease-classification
This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on clinical and demographic data.
The workflow follows a typical end-to-end data science pipeline, from data exploration to model evaluation and optimization.

# üìã Project Overview

The notebook walks through the following steps:

Problem Definition ‚Äì Understand the challenge and goals.

Data Collection ‚Äì Load and explore the dataset.

Evaluation ‚Äì Define success metrics (targeting 95% accuracy).

Feature Understanding ‚Äì Analyze and document dataset features.

Modeling ‚Äì Train multiple machine learning models.

Experimentation ‚Äì Tune hyperparameters and select the best model.

The dataset used comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
 and is also available on Kaggle
.
